## Raise Issues

If you run into something which doesn't work, raising [an issue](https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar/issues) with all the relevant information to reproduce it (i.e. the amod file) would be helpful.

## Code Fixes & New Things

I am happy to review any [pull requests](https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar/pulls). Please keep them as short as possible. Each pull request should be atomic and only address one issue. This helps with the review process.

Note that I will not accept everything, but I welcome discussion. So if it's a big change you are proposing, please raise it as an issue first for discussion.
