## ‚úç Write About The Project

If you find the project useful, spread the word! Articles, tweets, blog posts, instagram photos - whatever you're into. Please include a referral back to the gactar repository page: https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar

## üíª Contribute Example Models

If you've created a neat model, please consider adding it as an example! You can submit it as [an issue](https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar/pulls), or you can [contact me](https://asmaloney.com/contact/) directly.

## ‚òù Raise Issues

If you run into something which doesn't work as expected, raising [an issue](https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar/issues) with all the relevant information to reproduce it (i.e. the amod file and the error messages) would be helpful.

## üêû Bug Fixes & üß™ New Things

I am happy to review any [pull requests](https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar/pulls). Please keep them as short as possible. Each pull request should be atomic and only address one issue. This helps with the review process.

Note that I will not accept everything, but I welcome discussion. So if it's a big change you are proposing, please raise it as [an issue](https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar/issues) first for discussion.

## üí∞ Financial

Given that I'm an independent researcher without funding, financial support may affect how much time I devote to this project. If you would like to support the project financially, you can use the **Sponsor** button at the top of the [gactar](https://github.com/asmaloney/gactar) repository page.
